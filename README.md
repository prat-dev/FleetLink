#Vehicle Booking Application
This is a Next.js full-stack application that manages a vehicle booking system with:

Node.js backend for managing vehicles, calculating availability based on existing bookings and estimated ride times, and processing booking requests with data integrity.

React frontend providing a user interface to add vehicles, search for available vehicles by capacity, route, and start time, view vehicle availability with estimated ride duration, and initiate bookings.

MongoDB database for persistent storage of vehicles, bookings, and related data.

Features
Backend
Manage vehicle data including capacity and routes.

Calculate vehicle availability by analyzing current bookings and ride durations to avoid conflicts.

Validate booking requests to ensure no overlapping or invalid bookings.

Maintain data integrity throughout vehicle and booking management.

Frontend
Add new vehicles to the fleet with all necessary details.

Search for available vehicles filtered by capacity, route locations (pincodes), and desired start time.

Display search results with available vehicles and estimated ride durations.

Book selected vehicles easily through the interface.

Testing
Comprehensive unit tests for critical backend logic such as availability checks and booking validation.

Tests ensure reliable and consistent booking workflows.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (version 16 or higher)

MongoDB instance (local or remote)

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone <repository-url>
